They also have a dorsal hump (not a fin) and smaller bumps going down the remaining length of their back called knuckles. These whales tend to live in solitude, and are only seen together when mating or when a mother is with her young, who are typically found on their way to Alaska for summer feeding. They are easy to trail since they are the slowest swimmers, only reaching 4 knots on average. Gray whales are bottom feeders and their diet consists of mainly small crustaceans (like shrimp and krill) which they eat tons of every day. They do this by diving to the ocean floor and scooping up sediment, sifting out the food using their baleen plate made of keratin.',

This type of sea turtle is normally solitary, although congregates once a year for arribada, which is when the females lay around 100 eggs on a beach during the months of June to December. Olive Ridleys mainly just migrate or travel to wherever they can exploit the most feeding areas, though they mainly nest throughout eastern Pacific, depending on food rich zones, along the continental margins.

description: 'The genus Manta consists of two species -- Manta birostris (giant oceanic manta) and Manta alfredi (reef manta). These two species have much in common other than a few differences in life histories which greatly impact the management and conservation of the two. Reef mantas are nearly half the wing-span size of the oceanic manta, with a wing-span of 9-15ft and 13-23ft respectively. Divers are more likely to come across reef mantas which reside in shallow waters along the costal reefs of continents, archipelagos, and isolated oceanic islands. Creatures of habit, reef mantas frequent the same locations for decades, making research easier, and have a specific home range that they migrate around following plankton. The range of the oceanic manta overlaps with that of the reef manta, but these manta rays are more transitory. Oceanic rays have been sighted in slightly cooler waters of higher latitudes, in such places as South Carolina in the United States, and New Zealand’s North Island. However, they are most often found along coastlines with upwelling, oceanic island groups and offshore pinnacles. Oceanic rays can still be found by divers, but this species is more elusive Most manta rays have a black dorsal surface with a white ventral surface. Spotting on the ventral surface allows for fingerprint-like identification of individuals and the location of the spots also allows for identification of the species. Oceanic rays often lack spots on the belly, except the region close to the tail which has a small central cluster. These rays are darker in color around their gill slits and around/inside the mouth parts as well. Reef rays can have spotting anywhere on the ventral surface. ',

Despite their gigantic size, they are relatively gentle giants and harmless to humans. Their body is typically gray or gray-blue to brownish, with disruptive white grid lines and spots that are smaller around the head and bigger traveling towards the tail. They have a broad flat head with rounded snout, nostril barbels, and two dorsal fins set far back on the body with the first larger than the second. Their caudal fin is semi-crescent shaped with dual-lobes, and their body scales have a prominent central ridge. Whale sharks are carnivorous and normally solitary hunters. They suck in water through their enormous mouths and specially modified gill slits to actively filter feed for plankton, small nektonic fish, phytoplankton, and occasionally macroalgae. They also small teeth, totaling around 300 per dental row, but do not use these for feeding. Whale sharks can often be seen feeding in groups around dusk and during the night. Whale sharks are known to migrate in spring to the protected waters off Nigaloo Reef, near the central west coast of Australia. Individuals have also been documented to migrate occasionally according to food production and breeding seasons. Whale sharks are ovoviviparous, carrying up to 300 pups at a time, and prefer the waters off southeastern Taiwan for birthing. Newborns are almost 2ft in length. Overexploitation can have a detrimental impact on whale sharks due to their slow growth and maturation rate. They are listed as vulnerable (IUCN) and noted as conservation dependent (American Fisheries Society).',
